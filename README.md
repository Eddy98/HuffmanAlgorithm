# HuffmanAlgorithm
Implementation of Huffman Algorithm to encode and decode characters to and from 0s and 1s


Implement Huffmans algorithm.

Program summary:
-reads a file
-calculates the frequency of each character in the file
-places the characters and frequencies into a table indexed by the character
-runs the character frequency through Huffmans Algorithm and creates a Huffman Tree
-traverses the Huffman Tree and prints out the characters and frequencies
-reads a file and encodes the characters in the file using a Huffman Tree
-decodes a string of 1s and 0s using a Huffman Tree
